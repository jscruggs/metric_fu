== TODO list

* Determine how to test metric_fu against codebases that are not metric_fu, to ensure it works on most applications
* Add configurable logger to all output streams
* Color code flog results with scale from: http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-good-flog-score.html
* Make running metric_fu on metric_fu less embarrassing
* Load all gems at config time so you fail fast if one is missing
