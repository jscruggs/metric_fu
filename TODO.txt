== TODO list

* Sort Flog scores from worst to best
* Color code flog results with scale from: http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-good-flog-score.html
* Get churn to work with git
* Extract functionality from rake files and put under test
* Change churn start_date to not rely on Rails 1.day.ago functionality (so metric_fu can be used in non-Rails apps)
* Make integration with RSpec better (use SpecTask?)
* Integrate Flog, Saikuro, and Coverage into one report so you can see methods that have high complexity and low coverage (this is a big one)
* Integrate MD5 hashing with remainder of reports
